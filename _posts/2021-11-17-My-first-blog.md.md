title: "My experience with the Amfoss Tasks"
---

**Hello world**, this is my first blog post.

I can't wait to delve into the coding community at Amrita. I can't wait to come to the Campus and make new friends (online is impossible!). I joined Amritapuri solely for the awesome clubs they offered. And amfoss caught my eye right off the bat. I eagerly signed up for the recruitment procedure, clicked on the email as soon as it arrived, and began reading up the task document. What could go wrong?

A lot apparently. My experience with the tasks were unfortunately less than ideal. Things didn't go according to plan right from the start. My laptop started malfunctioning; by two days, half of its display was gone. God knows how I managed to do the things I did on that. 

Then came the fever. Nothing was done for more than a week. This, of course, shouldn't have been a huge obstacle if I had been as determined as I was in the beginning. One week of no work awakened the lazy man in me and I wasted almost all of the rest of the the time chatting online and watching shows. 

It was two things which happened simultaneously that brought me back to the sudden realisation I had fricked up. One, I got a new laptop and two, I joined a club meeting to hear some guy complain about how he had finished only 11 tasks. He was worried over how much was left. I was stunned. Whatever I have done beyond the first two tasks by the end of this recruitment program, I did in a frenzy after this jolt. I haphazardly tried to do a bunch of tasks together at first, only to fail and curse heavily.
I tried again and somehow two-three tasks were done. Right when I was gasping for some air, the course assignments began to pile up and I was suffocated under the mountain of rocks I had refused to move at the right time. I probably deserved it.

I understand that the club has better recruits waiting at its gates, and that I probably would not be selected this year. That's not ideal, but I accept it. But I promise not to waste my time any more. I will study what I can from the vidyaratna page, watch youtube tutorials and come back with a bang the next year.

Salud senior club members, for now.
